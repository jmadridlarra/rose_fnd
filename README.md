# Web Scraping the Target.com Website

*Abstract/Overview*
As Black women transition to natural hairstyles, they may try to navigate the “clean” hair product landscape. The marketing tactics and messages in the beauty products marketplace can be unclear, misleading, or even false. Little data exist about the textured hair product landscape, including the lack of a market or regulatory definition for “clean”. This paper provides an early analysis of products sold at a big box store, marketed primarily for textured hair in Los Angeles.  150 “clean” hair products were scraped from the Target.com website set with the home store zip code. 70% of products contained fragrance, a known endocrine disruptor. Furthermore, only 62 products were listed on the Environmental Working Group’s Skin Deep beauty product catalog and of these 62 products, over 90% were classified as a moderate risk to people’s health. These findings suggest that people with textured hair, overwhelmingly Black and brown women, are disproportionately affected by the harmful chemicals in products, even within the “clean” product market. Inadequate federal personal care product regulation, directed marketing, and inadequate market transparency can create challenges for women who are seeking to avoid harmful chemicals and maintain natural hair styles.
